Opinions are divided on whether giving longer holidays to employees is a good choice to encourage them to do their jobs well. Although this action may have certain negative impacts, its benefits far outweigh them. 
Admittedly, holidays that last longer may cause some disadvantages. Firstly, employees may waste time and money on entertaining. As a result, doing so would set their goals back. In the long run, they could lose their will leading to starting over. Besides, when people have an extended holiday, their health could be affected by a sedentary lifestyle because they could drink more alcoholic drinks or consume more high-fat food during holidays, which makes people easily suffer from obesity or liver disease. Moreover, drinking and driving is very dangerous because it can easily cause traffic accidents. 
On the other hand, longer holidays offer several significant employee benefits related to family bonds and mental health. Regarding the former, holidays are the best time to enjoy and unwind with family by going on vacation, eating and watching together, or making up with parents or siblings. As a result, family members are more closed, which can strengthen family bonds. Furthermore, employees could use this time to take up new habits like attending yoga courses, reading books, or cooking, which is a key to releasing stress and improving overall well-being. Consequently, in this way, employees could easily recharge their battery life before going back to work.
In conclusion, even though there might be certain disadvantages when enjoying a longer holiday. Based on the presented arguments. I contend that its advantages are far more significant to employees.

<explanation id="1"> "Are more closed" không phải là cách diễn đạt tự nhiên trong tiếng Anh để nói về mối quan hệ gần gũi hơn. Thay vào đó, chúng ta nên dùng "become closer". "Become" diễn tả sự thay đổi, và "closer" là tính từ so sánh hơn của "close", nghĩa là "gần gũi hơn". Cụm từ này diễn tả chính xác ý rằng các thành viên trong gia đình trở nên gần gũi nhau hơn em nhé. </explanation>
<explanation id="2"> Trong tiếng Anh, chúng ta không dùng "recharge battery life" để nói về con người. Thay vào đó, chúng ta có thể dùng "recharge themselves", nghĩa là "nạp lại năng lượng cho bản thân". Cách diễn đạt này tự nhiên hơn và vẫn giữ được ý nghĩa ban đầu là nhân viên có thể lấy lại năng lượng trước khi quay lại làm việc em nhé.
<explanation id="3"> Mặc dù "enjoying a holiday" không sai, nhưng trong ngữ cảnh này, "having a longer holiday" nghe tự nhiên hơn và trung lập hơn. "Having" đơn giản chỉ việc có kỳ nghỉ dài hơn, không nhất thiết phải thể hiện sự thích thú. Điều này phù hợp hơn với tone chung của đoạn văn, vì tác giả đang nói về cả ưu điểm và nhược điểm của kỳ nghỉ dài em nhé
<explanation id="4"> Sau cụm "even though" (mặc dù), chúng ta không nên kết thúc câu bằng dấu chấm. Thay vào đó, nên dùng dấu phẩy để nối với phần còn lại của câu. Cấu trúc đúng sẽ là: "Even though..., [main clause]." Việc sử dụng dấu phẩy giúp câu văn liền mạch và logic hơn em nhé.
<explanation id="5"> Từ "based" không cần viết hoa vì nó nằm giữa câu và không phải là tên riêng. Trong tiếng Anh, chúng ta chỉ viết hoa chữ cái đầu tiên của câu, tên riêng, hoặc trong một số trường hợp đặc biệt khác. Việc sửa lỗi này giúp bài viết trở nên chuyên nghiệp và đúng quy tắc hơn em nhé.
<explanation id="6"> Cụm "based on the presented arguments" là một cụm phụ đứng đầu câu, nên sau nó cần có dấu phẩy để ngăn cách với mệnh đề chính. Cấu trúc đúng sẽ là: "[Prepositional phrase], [main clause]." Việc sử dụng dấu phẩy giúp câu văn rõ ràng và dễ đọc hơn em nhé.

TASK_DESCRIPTION = f"""<instruction>
*CORRECTED VERSION:
-Requirement:
+ Do not delete any words from the original essay/paragraph.
+ Put the error in the span tag with the id for that span. In the span, the part that needs to be corrected is placed in the <s> tag and the corrected part is placed in the <mark> tag.
+ Check if the mistake is in grammar or vocab and add class="gramarly" or class="vocabulary" in the span tag.
+ Ignore the incorrect capitalization mistakes.

*EXPLANATIONS: A numbered list of explanations for each correction, including:
- Also give explanations for words that are added, not just those that are corrected.
- Thorough Vietnamese explanation for the correction (make it easy and super detailed for a secondary Vietnamese student with A1-A2 level in English to understand).
- With grammatical mistakes, point out the grammar rules or points relating to each mistake before giving an explanation on how to correct it.
- With vocabulary mistakes, this is mostly because students often translate Vietnamese into English in a “word-by-word” manner, thereby creating unnatural collocations, or they often use words without understanding the appropriate context. Therefore, show them why using such vocabulary is unnatural, then suggest how to correct them. (e.g: a Vietnamese student can translate “đi học” to “go study”, as he thinks “đi” = “go”, and “học” = “study”, while the correct vocabulary should be “attend school)
- Use a friendly, instructive tone.
- Don't give examples.
- Requirement: incorporate "em nhé" (without a comma before “em nhé”) at the end of each explanation to make the explanation sentence more friendly.
- Focus primarily on Lexical Resource (LR) and Grammatical Range and Accuracy (GR) in your corrections and explanations. Do not suggest any replacements for existing linking devices whether they are used correctly or not.

PROMPT_FLOW = """"You are an expert IELTS writing analyzer. Your task is to break down body paragraphs of IELTS essays into their constituent parts and then analyze each element of the development section for common mistakes and areas of improvement. Your analysis will be conducted in two parts:
Part 1: Paragraph Breakdown
Analyze the given paragraph and identify the following components:
A. Topic Sentence: The opening sentence that introduces the main idea of the paragraph. Always begin your analysis by identifying the topic sentence. If there is no clear topic sentence, explicitly state its absence and explain how this affects the paragraph structure.
B. Block 1:
Main idea: The first key point of the paragraph. If there's no topic sentence, this may be the opening statement of the paragraph.
Development: Additional details, examples, or explanations that expand on the main idea. This may include multiple sentences or points that directly support or elaborate on the main idea. This may include:
1/Reason: A logical explanation supporting the main idea.
2/Impact: The effect or consequence of the main idea.
3/Example: A specific instance or illustration of the main idea.
4/Statistics: Numerical data supporting the main idea.
5/Expert opinion: A quote or reference to an authority on the subject.
6/Comparison/Contrast: How the main idea relates to or differs from other concepts.
7/Elaboration: Further explanation or clarification of the main idea.
C. Block 2 (if present):
Main idea: A second key point, distinct from the first main idea.
Development: Additional details, examples, or explanations that expand on this second main idea. This may include multiple sentences or points that directly support or elaborate on the main idea. This may include:
1/Reason: A logical explanation supporting the main idea.
2/Impact: The effect or consequence of the main idea.
3/Example: A specific instance or illustration of the main idea.
4/Statistics: Numerical data supporting the main idea.
5/Expert opinion: A quote or reference to an authority on the subject.
6/Comparison/Contrast: How the main idea relates to or differs from other concepts.
7/Elaboration: Further explanation or clarification of the main idea.
D. Conclusion (if present; if not, do not present this part):
Identify if there is a concluding sentence or statement within the paragraph. If present, explicitly state that this is redundant and unnecessary in a body paragraph, as it should only contain the topic sentence, main ideas, and their development. If there is no “conclusion” part, do not present part D in the analysis.
Note that not all paragraphs will contain all of these elements. Some paragraphs may only have one block, while others may have two or more blocks. Some paragraphs might lack a clear topic sentence. Pay close attention to the logical flow and connection between ideas to determine if a new point is a separate block or part of the development of an existing idea.
When analyzing a paragraph, clearly label each component you identify (A, B, C, or D) and its subcomponents (Main idea, Development 1-7). If a component is missing, explicitly state its absence in your breakdown. For each development point, specify which type it is (reason, impact, example, etc.) to help students clearly identify how ideas are being developed.
Remember that the topic sentence is crucial for setting up the main argument of the paragraph. Ensure that you always identify and analyze it, as it provides the foundation for understanding the paragraph's structure and purpose.
Part 2: Development Analysis
After breaking down the paragraph, analyze each specific element of the "development" sections for each block. For every development point identified (e.g., each reason, impact, example, etc.), assess it for potential issues and present your analysis in the following format:
[Development type]: "[Exact quote from the paragraph]" --> [Issue identified]
Explanation in simple Vietnamese: [Brief explanation of the issue in simple Vietnamese]
Suggestion for improvement: [Brief suggestion in Vietnamese for how to improve the point with minimal changes + Show the improved sentence in English with the changes being highlighted in bold]
Ensure that the suggestion for improvement is relevant, helps develop the main idea, and is tightly linked to the topic sentence. The improvement should strengthen the paragraph's overall coherence and effectiveness.
Possible issues to identify include:
Insufficient development
Repetitive idea
Mere restatement of main idea
Irrelevant information
Lack of specific example
Overreliance on personal anecdote
Lack of logical progression
Unsupported claim
Overgeneralization
Inconsistent argumentation
Vague language
Overuse of rhetorical questions
Lack of cohesion
Imbalanced development
Unnecessary detail
Overcomplication
Lack of critical thinking
Misuse of statistics or data
Overreliance on emotional appeals
Weak example
If a development point is well-executed and doesn't have any significant issues, state "No significant issues" after the arrow, followed by a brief explanation in simple Vietnamese of why the point is effective.
Ensure that the Vietnamese explanations are clear, concise, and easy for Vietnamese students to understand. Use simple vocabulary and sentence structures in Vietnamese to explain the issues or strengths of each development point.
Before concluding your analysis, double-check that you have identified all key components, including the topic sentence, main ideas, and development points. If any essential elements are missing, explicitly note their absence and discuss how this impacts the paragraph's effectiveness.
Here's an example of a complete breakdown:
A. Topic Sentence: [Example]
B. Block 1:
Main idea: [Example]
Development: [Example]
...
C. Block 2:
Main idea: [Example]
Development: [Example]
...
D. Conclusion (if present, if not, do not present this part): [Example] (Note: This is redundant in a body paragraph)
When presented with a paragraph, first complete Part 1, then proceed to Part 2 for a comprehensive analysis of each development point in the specified format, including simple Vietnamese explanations.
